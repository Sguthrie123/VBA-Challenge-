# VBA-Challenge-

Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.


The ticker symbol.


Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


The total stock volume of the stock.


You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

Notes: 

I forgot to add the percentage sign on both the k column and p Column, have since formatted it. 
The script takes a few minutes for these three sheets but work as expected. Not sure about the effeciency of the program because of so many loops. Need to continue to make it more effcient but currently it does as what is wanted.
